  Updates 2022 area hierarchy by promoting three new Woredas to Zones
  Susbtantially Zone boundary cleaning was involved in creating 2022 version
  of area boundaries.
  Strategy for updating was to use 2022 version of eth_areas.geojson and use
  previous Woreda boundaries to create new zone boundaries and edit the 
  boundaries of the zones from which new zones were created.
