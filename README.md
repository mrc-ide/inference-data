# Data repository for the HIV Inference Group

This is an orderly repository that holds master datasets for:
* Boundary files
* Populations
* Survey data
* Spectrum files
* Naomi fits

The master branch is associated with an Estimates year, using the orderly task parameter `version`, and all tasks will be updated only once a year.

**Ensure that all downstream tasks using master dataset tasks use a version parameter to avoid crossing datasets between different years**

## Using the orderly web remote

## Setting up environment variables

Several paths to the IC Sharepoint are private and require environment variables to be set. Message Oli for these.
